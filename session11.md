## Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on using sample data to make generalizations (inferences) about a larger population. It involves estimating population parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions based on sample data. Unlike descriptive statistics, which summarize the data at hand, inferential statistics allow us to draw conclusions beyond the immediate data.

Key Concepts in Inferential Statistics
### Population and Sample:
Population: The entire set of individuals or items of interest.
Sample: A subset of the population, used to make inferences about the population.

### Parameter and Statistic:

Parameter: A numerical characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean 
μ
μ, population standard deviation 
σ
σ).

Statistic: A numerical characteristic of a sample (e.g., sample mean 
x
ˉ
x
ˉ
 , sample standard deviation 
s
s).

Sampling Distribution:

The distribution of a statistic (e.g., sample mean) over many samples drawn from the same population.

Central Limit Theorem (CLT): States that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, if the sample size is large enough.

Estimation:

Point Estimate: A single value used to estimate a population parameter (e.g., sample mean 
x
ˉ
x
ˉ
  as an estimate of population mean 
μ
μ).

Interval Estimate: A range of values (confidence interval) within which the population parameter is expected to lie.

Hypothesis Testing:

A method to test assumptions (hypotheses) about population parameters using sample data.

Involves:

Null Hypothesis (
H
0
H 
0
​
 ): A statement of no effect or no difference.

Alternative Hypothesis (
H
1
H 
1
​
 ): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.

Significance Level (
α
α): The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (e.g., 0.05).

p-value: The probability of observing the sample data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.

Types of Errors:

Type I Error: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive).

Type II Error: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative).
