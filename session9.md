# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software around objects instead of logic and functions. It's a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to structure code.

Key concepts of OOP
### 1) Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to some components of an object. It's similar to data-hiding. 
### 2) Inheritance: The passing of characteristics from a parent to a child. 
### 3) Polymorphism: The ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
### 4) Abstraction: The process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outside world. 
Benefits of OOP
OOP makes code more modular, flexible, and intuitive. 
OOP is useful for modeling complex systems with multiple entities and interactions. 
OOP is useful for encapsulating data and behavior into reusable components. 
When to use OOP
OOP is a cornerstone in modern programming. It's used in many programming languages, including Java and C++. 
## Class
A class is a structure which has provision to hold data and functions.

### Class Functions


## Object

Objects are collections of data and methods that perform data.

### Creating objects of a particular class

### Inheritance
